# My Portfolio

## WHY
This is my first portfolio to showcase my work as a full stack developer for potential future employers.I will be able to continue to update this portfolio as I add projects and or change styling of the page itself. 
## WHAT I DID 
I created a mobile-first responsive web design portfolio, using a neutral color scheme that shows my works, who I am , and ways to contact me.
## WHAT I LEARNED
My key takeaways from this project are as follows:
1- Wireframing is key! 
2- Devtools are a wonderful way to play around with styling and dimensions.
3- Starting earlier on a project is better , as you can continue to tweak and make adjustments as you go, instead of having to just make sure the project is completed in time.
## SCREENSHOTS 
Below is my very first attempt at my webpage, following are images of the final project three different layouts for all screen sizes.
